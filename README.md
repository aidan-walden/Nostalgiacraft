# Nostalgiacraft

Nostalgiacraft is a Minecraft mod for the Fabric mod loader. Nostalgiacraft aims to restore certain client-side features of old versions of Minecraft, mainly versions that are considered the "golden age of Minecraft" or "Notch-era" Minecraft. **Nostalgiacraft's purpose is to accomplish things that are not already possible using resource packs or vanilla in-game settings.**

This is my first public Minecraft mod, and Java is not my primary programming language. With that said, opening issues and pull requests is especially encouraged!

**Nostalgiacraft is a mod for Fabric, and there are no plans to port this mod to Forge.**

## Implemented features

* Restore [version watermark in the top-left corner of the screen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/b/bf/Beta_1.6_in-game.png/revision/latest?cb=20191221220138&format=original)
